# Getting Started

This simple application is created to demonstrate a microservice architecture based on MongoDB/SpringBoot solution stack. The RESTful services provide via their endpoints different types of aviation data (NOTAMs, airports, NAVAIDs etc.) encoded in GeoJSON.

Currently only several test NOTAMs have geometries. 

Once the application is up and running locally the Swagger API description will be available at http://localhost:9091/swagger-ui/

and NOTAM geospatial example can be queried for testing using this URL:
http://localhost:9091/notamsarea?lon=-2.181943&lat=47.943889&d=1
